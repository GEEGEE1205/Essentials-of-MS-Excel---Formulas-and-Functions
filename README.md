### Microsoft Excel Fundamentals 

   As part of my continuous learning journey in Data Analysis, I enrolled in a Microsoft Excel course offered by [UniAthena](https://www.uniathena.com/). This course provided me with foundational and practical skills essential for working with data in Excel, which is one of the most widely used tools in the data analytics field.

  This repository serves as a documentation of the key lessons covered and the knowledge gained during this course. It is also meant to showcase my commitment to mastering Excel for data preparation, transformation, and reporting.

- **Course Modules & Lessons**

  The course was divided into two main modules, each focusing on crucial Excel formatting and functional capabilities:

  - **Module 1**: Formatting Operations in Microsoft Excel

This module covered essential formatting skills to make spreadsheets visually clear, organized, and presentation ready.
    - Lesson 1: Cutting, Copying & Pasting Data
      - Learned how to move data across cells using the cut, copy, and paste commands
      - Explored advanced paste options like Paste Special for values, formats, formulas, and transposition.
   - Lesson 2: Insert, Hide, Column Width & Row Height
   - Gained skills in:
     -Inserting and deleting rows/columns
     -Hiding/unhiding** data for cleaner views
     -Adjusting row height and column width to improve readability
     - Using AutoFit to resize automatically based on content.
   - Lesson 3: Alignments
     - Learned to control the placement of text within cells using:
       - Horizontal & vertical alignment
       - Indentation
       - Wrap text
       - Merge & center features for formatting headers
   - Lesson 4: Themes & Styles
     - Applied Excel Themes to harmonize colors, fonts, and effects across sheets.
     - Used Cell Styles to format data categories such as input, output, and calculations for clarity and professionalism.
  - Lesson 5: Organizing Data in Excel
     - Techniques to maintain structured and clean datasets:
       - Sorting and filtering data
       - Freezing panes
       - Using tables for dynamic ranges
       - Grouping and outlining large datasets

- **Module 2**: Excel Functions and Analysis Tools

  - This module introduced functional tools that support calculations, logic-building, and data summarization.
      - Lesson 1: Basic Excel Functions
        - Covered foundational functions like:
        - SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT
          - Useful for quick descriptive statistics and numerical summaries
      - Lesson 2: IF Functions
        - Used logical formulas like:
        - IF, IFERROR, IFS and nested IF statements
            - Practical for decision-making scenarios and conditional outputs (e.g., Pass/Fail logic)
     - Lesson 3: Pivot Tables
       - Created Pivot Tables for summarizing large datasets without complex formulas.
         - Learned to:
           - Drag fields into rows, columns, values, filter
           - Apply sorting, grouping, and value formatting
           - Generate Pivot Charts for visualization
     - Lesson 4: Text Functions in Excel
       - Manipulated and cleaned text data using:
          - LEFT, RIGHT, MID, LEN, CONCAT, TEXTJOIN, TRIM, LOWER, UPPER, PROPER
          - Essential for transforming inconsistent or raw data into usable formats
     - Lesson 5: Cell Referencing
      - Understood the difference between:
          - Relative referencing (A1) – adjusts automatically
          - Absolute referencing (\$A\$1) – fixed reference
          - Mixed referencing (A\$1 or \$A1) – partial locking
             - This is crucial for building dynamic and reusable formulas.

- **Why This Matters**

  - Excel remains a fundamental tool in any data analyst’s toolbox. Mastering both formatting operations and functional logic equips me to:

    - Clean and prepare datasets
    - Analyze and summarize information
    - Present findings in a professional manner
    - Build dashboards and reports that support data-driven decisions
